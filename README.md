### Setup
Note: The release for your operating system may not be code signed yet, so you may need to right click to open the file.

When you open HFvZ on your operating system for the first time, it will create a set of public and private keys for you that you can use to interact with others. These are stored in a private keystore (Lair) on your own machine and are used during future uses.


### Usage

HFvZ is software that runs locally on your computer and connects with other instances to form a peer-to-peer network.

At present, simply open the software and begin using.
